<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hello! I am Gayan Sharma and I am a passionate web developer with a keen eye for design and a strong focus on building functional and user-friendly websites. I specialize in creating responsive and dynamic websites using the latest technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React and Node.js. My goal is to bring ideas to life on the web, whether it's a personal project or a collaborative team effort.</p>
<br><p>With a background in both front-end and back-end development, I am adept at handling all aspects of web creation, from crafting pixel-perfect designs to implementing robust server-side solutions. I am always exploring new trends and tools in the web development space, aiming to improve user experience and site performance.</p>
<br><p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy learning about UI/UX design, working on open-source projects, and staying up-to-date with the latest industry developments.
Let's create something amazing together</p>
